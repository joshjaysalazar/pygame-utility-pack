## Installation

Pygkit is currently in early development and cannot yet be installed via PyPi. To install it, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the base folder of your local clone in the terminal.
3. Type `python -m pip install -e .` to install it (replacing `python` with the appropriate name for the Python version to which you wish to install the libraryâ€”on Windows usually `py.exe`, and on Mac/Linux usually `python3`).

## Usage

To use Pygkit in your Pygame project, simply import the desired module(s) and use them alongside your existing Pygame code. Here's an example of importing and using the debug module:

```python
import pygame
import pygkit

pygame.init()

### Pygame setup here ###

debug_overlay = pygkit.debug.DebugOverlay(screen)

while True: 

    ### Game loop logic here ###

    debug_overlay.draw(
        position="topright",
        background_enabled=False,
        test_message="This is a test message."
    )
```

## Modules

Pygkit will be designed to work alongside Pygame, providing additional functionality through various modules. Here are a few of the planned modules:

- **Sprite**: A sprite sheet loader, an animated sprite class, etc.
- **AI**: Tools and algorithms to help you create engaging game AI.
- **GUI**: Components for creating menus, text boxes, and other user interface elements.
- **Debug**: Various debug overlays that can be used to display real-time game information during development.
- *And more to come!*

## Examples

You can find examples showcasing how to use Pygkit's features in various scenarios in the `examples` folder of the repository.
